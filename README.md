# NASA Deep Learning Project 🚀

This project presents a deep learning approach for analyzing and processing data related to NASA or space-related applications. The main implementation is contained in a single Jupyter notebook file: `NASA.ipynb`.

## 📘 Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and preparation.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.
- A deep learning model built using TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on implementation).
- Training, evaluation, and performance metrics.
- Visual outputs to support understanding of model behavior.

## 📂 File

- `NASA.ipynb`: The complete project notebook, including code, outputs, and explanations.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy / Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch *(whichever you used inside)*

## 🚀 How to Run

To run this notebook:

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Make sure to install the necessary Python libraries.
