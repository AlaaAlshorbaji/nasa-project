# 🚀 NASA Data Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for classifying NASA-related data using several classification algorithms. The workflow includes data analysis, preprocessing, training multiple models, and evaluating their performance using standard metrics.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To classify observations in a NASA dataset using machine learning classifiers and compare their performance based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes a set of features (possibly sensor or mission data) along with a target variable for classification.  
The features include numerical values that describe patterns in the observations.

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `pandas` and `numpy` – for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` – for data visualization
- `warnings` – to suppress warnings
- `scikit-learn` – for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- `tensorflow` – optionally imported but not explicitly used

---

## 📂 Workflow Summary

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Read the dataset using pandas.
- Explored the shape, types, and missing values.
- Plotted distributions and correlations between variables.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables if needed.
- Applied `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical features.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets using an 80-20 ratio.

### 3. Model Building
Multiple classifiers were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Voting Classifier (ensemble of top-performing models)

### 4. Model Evaluation
Each model was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- **R² Score** and **Mean Squared Error** for regression (if applied)

Plots and tables were used to visualize performance differences between models.

---

## 📈 Results

- The ensemble Voting Classifier achieved competitive performance by combining multiple models.
- Feature scaling significantly improved the performance of distance-based models like KNN and SVM.
- Models were evaluated consistently using the same test set for fair comparison.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Download the notebook `NASA.ipynb`.
2. Open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Install required packages (if needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
4. Run all cells in order from top to bottom to execute the entire machine learning pipeline.

## 📌 Recommendations & Future Improvements

- Perform **hyperparameter tuning** using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize model performance.
- Use **cross-validation** to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting.
- Introduce **feature selection** or **dimensionality reduction** techniques like PCA to improve model interpretability.
- Apply **SHAP** or **LIME** for explainability and to understand feature impact on predictions.
- Deploy the final model using a web-based interface such as **Streamlit**, **Flask**, or **FastAPI**.
